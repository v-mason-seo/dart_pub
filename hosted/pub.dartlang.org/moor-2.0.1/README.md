# moor

Moor is an easy to use, reactive persistence library for Flutter apps. 
Define your database tables in pure Dart and enjoy a fluent query API,
auto-updating streams and more!

## With Flutter
This library defines the APIs for the moor persistence library. To use it on Flutter apps,
you'll probably want to use the moor_flutter implementation directly.

## For the web
For information to use this library on the web (including Flutter web), follow the 
instructions [here](https://moor.simonbinder.eu/web). Keep in mind that web support is
still experimental.

Please see the homepage of [moor](https://moor.simonbinder.eu/) or
the [moor_flutter package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/moor_flutter) for details
on how to use this package.
