## [5.0.1] - 23.09.2020

* fixed formatting in readme

## [5.0.0-mixin-version] - 17.09.2020

* experimental

## [5.0.0] - 15.09.2020

* New scope support for registration
* optional dispose functions for registered objects
* **Breaking change:** `reset()` now is async and returns a `Future` because it will call the new optional disposal functions that can be async
* **Breaking change:** If you use names to register your objects you now have to provide a type too or at least make sure the compiler can infer the type. With this change it is now possible to use the same name for different types.

## [3.0.0+1] - 07.09.2019

* Small fix to make the analyser happy

## [3.0.0] - 07.09.2019

* Overhauled the signalling API because the way it was was not optimal. Now you can either signal globally or by passing the instance of the registered object that shall signal. This way it's ensured that you have to have access to the instance to signal, typically from within the instance with a `GetIt.instance.signalReady(this)` 
individual signalling from other places but the instance itself is probably an error.
* Unregister of singletons /lazysingletons now possible also over a registered instance.
* Most asserts have bin replaced with throwing `Error`objects.
* The example now shows the ready signalling.
