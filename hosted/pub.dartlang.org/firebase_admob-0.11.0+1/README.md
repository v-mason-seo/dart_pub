# firebase_admob

A plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.io) that supports loading and
displaying banner, interstitial (full-screen), and rewarded video ads using the
[Firebase AdMob API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/).

For Flutter plugins for other Firebase products, see [README.md](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/blob/master/README.md).

## AndroidManifest changes

AdMob 17 requires the App ID to be included in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. Failure
to do so will result in a crash on launch of your app.  The line should look like:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
    android:value="[ADMOB_APP_ID]"/>
```

where `[ADMOB_APP_ID]` is your App ID.  You must pass the same value when you 
initialize the plugin in your Dart code.

See https://goo.gl/fQ2neu for more information about configuring `AndroidManifest.xml`
and setting up your App ID.

## Info.plist changes

Admob 7.42.0 requires the App ID to be included in `Info.plist`. Failure to do so will result in a crash on launch of your app. The lines should look like:

```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>[ADMOB_APP_ID]</string>
```

where `[ADMOB_APP_ID]` is your App ID.  You must pass the same value when you initialize the plugin in your Dart code.

See https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start#update_your_infoplist for more information about configuring `Info.plist` and setting up your App ID.

## Initializing the plugin
The AdMob plugin must be initialized with an AdMob App ID.

```dart
FirebaseAdMob.instance.initialize(appId: appId);
```
### Android
Starting in version 17.0.0, if you are an AdMob publisher you are now required to add your AdMob app ID in your **AndroidManifest.xml** file. Once you find your AdMob app ID in the AdMob UI, add it to your manifest adding the following tag:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- TODO: Replace with your real AdMob app ID -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
            android:value="ca-app-pub-################~##########"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Failure to add this tag will result in the app crashing at app launch with a message starting with *"The Google Mobile Ads SDK was initialized incorrectly."*

On Android, this value must be the same as the App ID value set in your 
`AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS
Starting in version 7.42.0, you are required to add your AdMob app ID in your **Info.plist** file under the Runner directory. You can add it using Xcode or edit the file manually:

```xml
<dict>
	<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
	<string>ca-app-pub-################~##########</string>
</dict>
```

Failure to add this tag will result in the app crashing at app launch with a message including *"GADVerifyApplicationID."*

## Firebase related changes

You are also required to ensure that you have Google Service file from Firebase inside your project.

### iOS

Create an "App" in firebase and generate a GoogleService-info.plist file. This file needs to be embedded in the projects "Runner/Runner" folder using Xcode. 

https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#create-firebase-project -> Steps 1-3

### Android

Create an "App" in firebase and generate a google-service.json file. This file needs to be embedded in you projects "android/app" folder. 

https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#create-firebase-project -> Steps 1-3.1

## Using banners and interstitials
Banner and interstitial ads can be configured with target information.
And in the example below, the ads are given test ad unit IDs for a quick start.

```dart
MobileAdTargetingInfo targetingInfo = MobileAdTargetingInfo(
  keywords: <String>['flutterio', 'beautiful apps'],
  contentUrl: 'https://flutter.io',
  birthday: DateTime.now(),
  childDirected: false,
  designedForFamilies: false,
  gender: MobileAdGender.male, // or MobileAdGender.female, MobileAdGender.unknown
  testDevices: <String>[], // Android emulators are considered test devices
);

BannerAd myBanner = BannerAd(
  // Replace the testAdUnitId with an ad unit id from the AdMob dash.
  // https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads
  // https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/test-ads
  adUnitId: BannerAd.testAdUnitId,
  size: AdSize.smartBanner,
  targetingInfo: targetingInfo,
  listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {
    print("BannerAd event is $event");
  },
);

InterstitialAd myInterstitial = InterstitialAd(
  // Replace the testAdUnitId with an ad unit id from the AdMob dash.
  // https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads
  // https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/test-ads
  adUnitId: InterstitialAd.testAdUnitId,
  targetingInfo: targetingInfo,
  listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {
    print("InterstitialAd event is $event");
  },
);
```

Ads must be loaded before they're shown.
```dart
myBanner
  // typically this happens well before the ad is shown
  ..load()
  ..show(
    // Positions the banner ad 60 pixels from the bottom of the screen
    anchorOffset: 60.0,
    // Positions the banner ad 10 pixels from the center of the screen to the right
    horizontalCenterOffset: 10.0,
    // Banner Position
    anchorType: AnchorType.bottom,
  );
```

```dart
myInterstitial
  ..load()
  ..show(
    anchorType: AnchorType.bottom,
    anchorOffset: 0.0,
    horizontalCenterOffset: 0.0,
  );
```

`BannerAd` and `InterstitialAd` objects can be disposed to free up plugin
resources. Disposing a banner ad that's been shown removes it from the screen.
Interstitial ads, however, can't be programmatically removed from view.

Banner and interstitial ads can be created with a `MobileAdEvent` listener. The
listener can be used to detect when the ad has actually finished loading
(or failed to load at all).

## Using rewarded video ads

Unlike banners and interstitials, rewarded video ads are loaded one at a time
via a singleton object, `RewardedVideoAd.instance`. Its `load` method takes an
AdMob ad unit ID and an instance of `MobileAdTargetingInfo`:
```dart
RewardedVideoAd.instance.load(myAdMobAdUnitId, targetingInfo);
```

To listen for events in the rewarded video ad lifecycle, apps can define a
function matching the `RewardedVideoAdListener` typedef, and assign it to the
`listener` instance variable in `RewardedVideoAd`. If set, the `listener`
function will be invoked whenever one of the events in the `RewardedVideAdEvent`
enum occurs. After a rewarded video ad loads, for example, the
`RewardedVideoAdEvent.loaded` is sent. Any time after that, apps can show the ad
by calling `show`:
```dart
RewardedVideoAd.instance.show();
```

When the AdMob SDK decides it's time to grant an in-app reward, it does so via
the `RewardedVideoAdEvent.rewarded` event:
```dart
RewardedVideoAd.instance.listener =
    (RewardedVideoAdEvent event, {String rewardType, int rewardAmount}) {
  if (event == RewardedVideoAdEvent.rewarded) {
    setState(() {
      // Here, apps should update state to reflect the reward.
      _goldCoins += rewardAmount;
    });
  }
};
```

Because `RewardedVideoAd` is a singleton object, it does not offer a `dispose`
method.

## Using native ads

Native Ads are presented to users via UI components that
are native to the platform. (e.g. A
[View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View) on Android or a
[UIView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview?language=objc)
on iOS). Using Flutter widgets to create native ads is NOT supported by
this.

Since Native Ads require UI components native to a platform, this feature requires additional setup
for Android and iOS:

### Android
The Android Admob Plugin requires a class that implements `NativeAdFactory` which contains a method
that takes a
[UnifiedNativeAd](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/formats/UnifiedNativeAd)
and custom options and returns a
[UnifiedNativeAdView](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/formats/UnifiedNativeAdView).

You can implement this in your `MainActivity.java` or create a separate class in the same directory
as `MainActivity.java` as seen below:

```java
package my.app.path;

import com.google.android.gms.ads.formats.UnifiedNativeAd;
import com.google.android.gms.ads.formats.UnifiedNativeAdView;
import io.flutter.plugins.firebaseadmob.FirebaseAdMobPlugin.NativeAdFactory;
import java.util.Map;

class NativeAdFactoryExample implements NativeAdFactory {
  @Override
  public UnifiedNativeAdView createNativeAd(
      UnifiedNativeAd nativeAd, Map<String, Object> customOptions) {
    // Create UnifiedNativeAdView
  }
}
```

An instance of a `NativeAdFactory` should also be added to the `FirebaseAdMobPlugin`. This is done
slightly differently depending on whether you are using Embedding V1 or Embedding V2.

If you're using the Embedding V1, you need to register your `NativeAdFactory` with a unique `String`
identifier after calling `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(this);`.

You're `MainActivity.java` should look similar to:

```java
package my.app.path;

import android.os.Bundle;
import io.flutter.app.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;
import io.flutter.plugins.firebaseadmob.FirebaseAdMobPlugin;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(this);

    FirebaseAdMobPlugin.registerNativeAdFactory(this, "adFactoryExample", new NativeAdFactoryExample());
  }
}
```

If you're using Embedding V2, you need to register your `NativeAdFactory` with a unique `String`
identifier after adding the `FirebaseAdMobPlugin` to the `FlutterEngine`. (Adding the
`FirebaseAdMobPlugin` to `FlutterEngine` should be done in a `GeneratedPluginRegistrant` in the near
future, so you may not see it being added here). You should also unregister the factory in
`cleanUpFlutterEngine(engine)`.

You're `MainActivity.java` should look similar to:

```java
package my.app.path;

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine;
import io.flutter.plugins.firebaseadmob.FirebaseAdMobPlugin;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
  @Override
  public void configureFlutterEngine(FlutterEngine flutterEngine) {
    flutterEngine.getPlugins().add(new FirebaseAdMobPlugin());

    FirebaseAdMobPlugin.registerNativeAdFactory(flutterEngine, "adFactoryExample", NativeAdFactoryExample());
  }

  @Override
  public void cleanUpFlutterEngine(FlutterEngine flutterEngine) {
    FirebaseAdMobPlugin.unregisterNativeAdFactory(flutterEngine, "adFactoryExample");
  }
}
```

When creating the `NativeAd` in Flutter, the `factoryId` parameter should match the one you used to
add the factory to `FirebaseAdMobPlugin`.

An example of displaying a `UnifiedNativeAd` with a `UnifiedNativeAdView` can be found
[here](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/native/advanced). The example app also inflates
a custom layout and displays the test Native ad.

### iOS
Native Ads for iOS require a class that implements the protocol `FLTNativeAdFactory` which has a
single method `createNativeAd:customOptions:`.

You can have your `AppDelegate` implement this protocol or create a separate class as seen below:

```objectivec
/* AppDelegate.m */

#import "FLTFirebaseAdMobPlugin.h"

@interface NativeAdFactoryExample : NSObject<FLTNativeAdFactory>
@end

@implementation NativeAdFactoryExample
- (GADUnifiedNativeAdView *)createNativeAd:(GADUnifiedNativeAd *)nativeAd
                             customOptions:(NSDictionary *)customOptions {
  // Create GADUnifiedNativeAdView
}
@end
```

Once there is an implementation of `FLTNativeAdFactory`, it must be added to the
`FLTFirebaseAdMobPlugin`. This is done by importing `FLTFirebaseAdMobPlugin.h` and calling
`registerNativeAdFactory:factoryId:nativeAdFactory:` with a `FlutterPluginRegistry`, a unique
identifier for the factory, and the factory itself. The factory also *MUST* be added after
`[GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];` has been called.

If this is done in `AppDelegate.m`, it should look similar to:

```objectivec
#import "FLTFirebaseAdMobPlugin.h"

@implementation AppDelegate
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];

  NativeAdFactoryExample *nativeAdFactory = [[NativeAdFactoryExample alloc] init];
  [FLTFirebaseAdMobPlugin registerNativeAdFactory:self
                                        factoryId:@"adFactoryExample"
                                  nativeAdFactory:nativeAdFactory];

  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

@end
```

### Dart Example

When creating a Native Ad in Dart, setup is similar to Banners and Interstitials. You can use
`MobileAdTargetingInfo` to target ads, create a listener to respond to `MobileAdEvent`s, and test
with a test ad unit id. Your `factoryId` should match the id used to register the `NativeAdFactory`
in Java/Kotlin/Obj-C/Swift. An example of this implementation is seen below:

```dart
MobileAdTargetingInfo targetingInfo = MobileAdTargetingInfo(
  keywords: <String>['flutterio', 'beautiful apps'],
  contentUrl: 'https://flutter.io',
  birthday: DateTime.now(),
  childDirected: false,
  designedForFamilies: false,
  gender: MobileAdGender.male, // or MobileAdGender.female, MobileAdGender.unknown
  testDevices: <String>[], // Android emulators are considered test devices
);

final NativeAd nativeAd = NativeAd(
  adUnitId: NativeAd.testAdUnitId,
  factoryId: 'adFactoryExample',
  targetingInfo: targetingInfo,
  listener: (MobileAdEvent event) {
    print("$NativeAd event $event");
  },
);
```

## Limitations

This plugin currently has some limitations:

- Banner ads cannot be animated into view.
- It's not possible to specify a banner ad's size.
- The existing tests are fairly rudimentary.
- There is no API doc.
- The example should demonstrate how to show gate a route push with an
  interstitial ad
