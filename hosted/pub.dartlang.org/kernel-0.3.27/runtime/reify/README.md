# Runtime Support for Reified Generic Types

This subdirectory contains files used at runtime by the code generated by
[../reify_transformer.dart].

The files in this directory can be imported by anyone, but files in this
directory should be frugal about importing anything themselves. This is because
this library is used by all programs that are tranformed and contributes to
code size.
