## [1.4.2] - 2020-09-10
* Compatibility with Flutter version 1.22.

## [1.4.1] - 2020-06-14
* Bugfix: CacheManager returned a file that didn't exist when the file was removed by the OS (or any other external system)
while the app was active. This also prevented the CacheManager to redownload the file ([PR #190](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter_cache_manager/pull/190)).

## [1.4.0] - 2020-06-04
* Allow cleaning of memory cache ([PR #183](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter_cache_manager/pull/183)).
* Bugfix: Cleaning doesn't want to delete a file twice anymore ([PR #185](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter_cache_manager/pull/185)).

## [1.3.0] - 2020-05-28
* Basic web support. (At least it downloads the file for you.)
* Support for the following mimetypes:
    * application/vnd.android.package-archive (apk)
    * audio/x-aac (aac)
    * video/quicktime (mov)

## [1.2.2] - 2020-04-16
* Support for RxDart 0.24.x

## [1.2.1] - 2020-04-14
* Fixed optional parameters in the Content-Type header ([#164](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter_cache_manager/issues/164)).

## [1.2.0] - 2020-04-10
* Added getFileStream to CacheManager
    * getFileStream has an optional parameter 'withProgress' to receive progress.
    * getFileStream returns a FileResponse which is either a FileInfo or a DownloadProgress.
* Changes to FileFetcher and FileFetcherResponse:
    * FileFetcher is now replaced with a FileService which is a class instead of a function.
    * FileServiceResponse doesn't just give magic headers, but concrete implementation of the needed information.
    * FileServiceResponse gives a contentStream instead of content for more efficient handling of the data.
    * FileServiceResponse contains contentLength with information about the total size of the content.
* Changes in CacheStore for testability:
    * CleanupRunMinInterval can now be set.
    * Expects a mockable directory instead of a path.
* Added CacheInfoRepository interface to possibly replace the current CacheObjectProvider based on sqflite.
* Changes in WebHelper
  * Files are now always saved with a new name. Files are first saved to storage before old file is removed.
* General code quality improvements

## [1.1.3] - 2019-10-17
